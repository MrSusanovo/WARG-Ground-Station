The ground station that is not written in Qt.

Uses the following:
-jQuery: http://jquery.com/download/
-NW.js: http://nwjs.io/
-Leaflet: http://leafletjs.com/
-GMapCatcher: http://sepuweb.com/sample/GMapCatcher-0.8.0.6.exe

Map tiles are in OSM format. They can be downloaded and exported using GMapCatcher. Leaflet is the maps library used to display the tiles.

To setup, download NW.js for your os and put the files into the same directory as the code. Make a folder called sat_tiles and put the exported tiles into that. Download jquery-2.1.1.min.js, leaflet.js, and leaflet.css from the above links.
